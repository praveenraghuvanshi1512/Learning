- It’s standard practice when training neural networks to ensure that our inputs’ values are scaled such that they fall inside such a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- To sum it up, if weights are initialized too large, the network won’t learn well. The same happens when weights are initialized too small.
