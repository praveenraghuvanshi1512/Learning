# Microsoft AZ-900 : A 3 week Plan

### Why Certification?

A lot of people have a question in their mind that whether they should go for a certification or not? We have people from both the school of thought. One in favor of certification and others not very keen in going for it. I would consider certification as a platform to explore the technology and provides an opportunity to validate your understanding. Its more than reading a book on a topic. Definitely, there is no substitute for experience but not everyone gets opportunity to explore the breadth and depth of a technology. A certification broadens your horizon that can be utilized in problem solving. It helps a fresher/inexperienced person to jump start on a technology and also an experienced person to explore the breadth of a technology. 

### Why AZ-900?

If you are new to Azure or have some experience in it, this is the entry level certification.
