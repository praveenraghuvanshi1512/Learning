# Microsoft AZ-900 : A 3 week Plan

### Why Certification?

A lot of people have a question in their mind, whether they should go for a certification or not? We have people from both the school of thought. One in favor of certification and others not very keen in going for it. I would consider certification as a platform to explore the technology and provides an opportunity to validate your understanding. Its more than reading a book on a topic. Definitely, there is no substitute for experience but not everyone gets opportunity to explore the breadth and depth of a technology. A certification broadens your horizon that can be utilized in problem solving. It helps a fresher/inexperienced person to jump start on a technology and an experienced person to explore the breadth of a technology.  Certifications are relevant and beneficial only if you follow path.

*No Knowledge < Knowledge < Knowledge + Certification*

### AZ-900?

If you are new to Azure or have some experience in it, this is the entry level certification. The exam doesn't assume you to be an expert in Azure and only tests your knowledge on the topic at a high level. The main objective is to give an introduction to the services available in Azure. It spans across compute, networking, governance, policies, budgeting etc. For more details please refer *Resources* section below.
